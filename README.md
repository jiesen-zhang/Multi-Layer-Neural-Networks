# Multi-Layer-Neural-Networks

Implemented a multi-layer neural networks on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset and implemented the backpropagation without the use of any Machine Learning libraries. Wrote my own forward and backward pass and trained two- and three-layer networks with SGD and Adam optimizers.
